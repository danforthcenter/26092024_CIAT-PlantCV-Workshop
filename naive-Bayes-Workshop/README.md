# naive Bayes Workflow Tutorial
This directory contains workflows for analyzing leaf disease and roots in ground imaged using a minirhizotron device. Participants will need a copy of ImageJ/Fiji on their systems in order to collect the necessary pixel data from their images.

1. naiveBayes.pdf: PDF document that explains how PlantCV naive Bayes classifier works and protocol for collecting pixel data using ImageJ/Fiji.
2. Wheat-rust-workflow: This directory contains a workflow with RGB images of wheat grass leaves affected by wheat leaf rust fungus (*Puccinia triticina*).
3. Minirhizotron-root-workflow: This directory contains a workflow with RGB images of *Silphium* roots imaged using a minirhizotron device.
