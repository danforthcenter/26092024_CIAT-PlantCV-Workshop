    "Color Cards (or color checkers) are useful reference tools used by imaging experts to calibrate the colors in their images to ensure the accuracy and consistency of color reproduction in their images. The device usually consists of 24 color swatches (or patches) that are designed to mimic a range of colors commonly represented in nature (i.e., skin color, water, leaves, flowers, etc.) in addition to white, gray, and black to balance different lighting conditions. Due to the standardized layout of color cards, they can also be used to calibrate the sizes of other objects in your image so it is imperative that the color card is inline with your object-of-interest. For additional information on how to use a color card, visit the following [article](https://petapixel.com/how-to-use-color-checker-photography/) by Kyle Agee."
