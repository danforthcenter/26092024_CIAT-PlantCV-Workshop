# Multiple Plant Image Analysis with Parallel Workflow Execution Tutorial
This directory contains all materials needed to analyze images containing multiple plants in a tray. There is an additional document (*PlantCV-Parallel-Workflow-Execution.pdf*) to explain how to use **plantcv-train** and **plantcv-utils** to set up your PlantCV workflows for parallel execution of multiple images.

1. imgs: In this directory you will find several RGB images of multiple *Arabidopsis thaliana* in a tray.
2. START-HERE_multi-plant-workflow.ipynb: This is a blank PlantCV workflow.
3. multi-plant-workflow-reference.ipynb: This a completed multiple plant RGB image workflow completed with PlantCV functions.
4. PlantCV-Parallel-Workflow-Execution.pdf: A PDF containing information on setting up PlantCV workflows for parallel execution over several images.
5. plot_results.ipynb: This notebook contains code to visualize data generated from workflow parallelization
