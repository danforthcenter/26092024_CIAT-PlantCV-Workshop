# Random Forest Classifier Tutorial
In this directory you will find materials for performing our **This Machine's Bean Learning** Random Forest Classifier Lab activity. This activity is designed to familiarize workshop participants on best practices for imaging samples, training data sets for machine learning, and using a Random Forest Classifier to classify a heterogeneous mixture of objects.

1. Blank-trait-extraction.ipynb: This PlantCV notebook contains all necessary code for developing a training data set for machine learning. Users will need to add necessary code related to their subject where labeled.
2. ml-classification-part2.ipynb: This PlantCV notebook takes the output CSV files produced from *Blank-trait-extraction.ipynb* to extract the most important physical features used by the random forest classifier to distinguish objects from one another. User then imports an RGB image of a heteregenous mixture of objects collected in training datasets and the random forest classifier will label each object based on the trained data.
3. Techniques_For_Capturing_images_Phenotyping.pdf: This PDF document contains important techniques and information on collecting quality images for data collection.
